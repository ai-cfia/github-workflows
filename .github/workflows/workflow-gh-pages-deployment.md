## Reusable Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages

   - **Purpose:** Build a Node.js project and deploy the static assets to GitHub Pages.
   - **Usage:** Call this workflow and provide `node-version`, `publish-dir`, `cache-dependency-path`, `working-dir` (optional, default is root), and `publish-branch` (optional, default is root) as inputs.
   - **Required Secrets:**
     - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This token is automatically generated by GitHub to enable push access to the repository.
