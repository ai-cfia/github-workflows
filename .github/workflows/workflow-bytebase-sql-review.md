# Bytebase SQL review

## Overview

This workflow is used to review SQL changes in Bytebase. It is triggered by a
pull request to the `main` branch of the calling repository.

## Usage

- **Purpose:** Parse and check the SQL statement according to the SQL review
  rules set in our Bytebase instance to detect SQL anti-patterns and enforce
  schema consistency across the organization.
- **Secrets:** Secrets need to be configured from the calling repository.
  - `BYTEBASE_API`: The API key used to authenticate with Bytebase.
  - `SQL_REVIEW_API_SECRET`: Secret generated by Bytebase to authenticate with
    the SQL review service.

Side note : The API key and secret can be regenerated from the Bytebase instance
through the creation of a service account following
