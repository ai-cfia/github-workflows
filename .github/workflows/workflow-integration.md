# Reusable integration workflow

- **Purpose:** Automate the setup, configuration, and integration processes for
the webtop template projects. This workflow authenticates with HashiCorp Vault
to store user credentials safely, installs necessary Python packages,
and executes the template rendering logic.

- **Usage:** Integrate this workflow into your webtop template projects to
streamline the integration process, making use of user-specific
information securely stored in Vault.

- **Inputs:**
  - `username`: The username for the integration, used for both template
  rendering and Vault storage.
  - `email`: The email associated with the integration, used for
  template rendering.

- **Note:** This workflow is currently primarily focused on integration
tasks related to the webtop template and is designed for extension
to accommodate future needs or additional steps within your projects.
